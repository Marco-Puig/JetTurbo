	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p class="style21"><strong><em>Overlapping road triangles near crossings</em></strong></p>
          <p class="style1">When the road angle with the crossing is too sharp, triangles may overlap. This especially happens at the start left of the road. A fix for now is to position the first marker nearby the crossing or reduce the angle of the road with the crossing.          </p>
          <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="style21"><strong><em>Small gaps between the road and T Crossings</em></strong></p>
          <p class="style1">This is related to Crossings &gt; General Settings &gt; Activate Bending. It can happen after road network refreshes andupdating scene instances of a specific road type. The T crossing shape is reset and not following the road bend anymore. This issue will be fixed. For now moving the crossing a little bit will update it. Or you can switch off &quot;Activate Bending&quot; if you do not need this feature.</p>
          <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="style1"><strong><em>Roundabouts are not correctly connected to the first or last marker</em></strong></p>
          <p class="style1">For now avoid attaching a roundabout to the first or last marker of the selected road. Instead use the other way to add intersections to the scene, by selecting the crossing connection prefabs tab <img src="../images/prefabs_tab.jpg" width="85" height="30" style="vertical-align:middle"> from the main EasyRoads3D Toolbar in the Inspector. Select the roundabout you want to instantiate from the list of available crossing prefabs, hold the SHIFT key and click in the scene where you want to position this roundabout. You can now connect roads to the prefab or start new roads by dragging the red roundabout connection handles. <a href="intersections.html#create" class="link">For full details click here</a>.</p>
          <p class="style21">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>Runtime API</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">This is related to road networks created with the runtime API. In order to preserve the original terrain data, make sure to backup the terrain objects in the scene! <br>
  <br>
  In general restoring the terrain works well but it has occured that the terrain remained in the Build state after exiting Play Mode leaving the road shape in the terrain. This particularly happened when you put focus on the scene view window while in Play Mode. Please test this on your end and keep a backup of your terrain(s) if you intend to use the runtime API to generate road networks.</p>
<p class="style21">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style21"><em>After splitting a road in two roads and selecting the first marker of the newly created road, the first marker of the original road is selected</em></p>
<p class="style1">When this happens you can simply click on the terrain to deselect the marker. Selecting it once again should work correctly. This will be looked into.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style21"><em>After Joining two roads side objects appear on the other side of the road</em></p>
<p class="style1">This happens when the markers of one of the two roads are reversed, basically the road points in the other direction. One thing to do here is to link identical side objects for the left and right side of the road.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style21"><em>Bumpy roads vs Circular Controller Type</em></p>
<p class="style1">When using values above 0.5 or below -0.5 for the Bumpiness Y offset on a circular segment, the road geometry may not be created correctly for that segment. The higher the value the more likely this will happen. This will be further optimized for now you can try moving the marker a little bit or reduce the bumpness values more towards 0 for that segment. Bumpiness values above 0.5 or below -0.5 are quite unusual for roads. But this can happen on a circular segment for, for example, a rather bumpy bike tracks.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style21"><em>Undo / Redo</em></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Undo &quot;Join two roads&quot;:</strong> This by itself works well, Undo/Redo should also work well unless this process is deeper in the undo stack. But, after Undo, one of the road shapes may not be updated. This will correct itself after moving a marker which is very likely to be a next step anyway. This will be looked in to.<br>
  <br>
  When using Shift +  J to join two roads, Undo works well but Redo may result in repetetive errors and can result in the material being reset. 2 Undo operations should resolve this.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Undo &quot;Detach road from connection&quot;:</strong> At first sight this appears to work well but moving the connection object afterwards will not adjust the attached road. Deselect &gt; Reselect the Road Network should fix that. This will be looked into.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Undo after Connection Prefab transform change: </strong>Attached roads may not be update when this operation is called from deeper in the undo stack. To fix this, select the connection prefab and move it a little bit so the attached roads update.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Undo after &quot;Delete Connection&quot;:</strong> this is not yet functional</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Undo after deselecting the road network:</strong> Performing Undo after deselecting the road network is unreliable. The changes will be undone but the road mesh may not update. To deal with this you can for now select the road and move a marker to force the update.</p>
<p><strong>Build Mode: </strong>It is not recommended to use Undo after switching to Build Mode. Instead use &quot;Back to Edit Mode&quot; button to switch back to Edit Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style21"><em>Dynamic Crossings , Sidewalks and I Connectors</em></p>
<p>For now avoid updating sidewalk settings on crossings when a road is attached with an I Connector on the other end. As a temporary workaround you can disconnect the road first from the I Connector, update the sidewalk and reconnect it to the I Connector afterwards.</p>
