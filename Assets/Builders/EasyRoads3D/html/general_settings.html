	        <li><a name="defaultIndent" id="defaultIndent"></a><span class="propertyStyle">Default Indent:</span> This gives control over the terrain deformation. The default values are  based on the terrains heightmapscale to ensure accurate terrain flattening according the road and crossings shapes. Optionally these values can be increased these here. The Indent value represents the distance from the edge of the roads outwards to the terrain point that should be leveled at the same height of the road at that point to guarantee most optimal terrain deformation results. This value can be tweaked per marker but can never be lower then the Scene Min Indent value. Different default indent values can also be set per road type.</li>

	        <li><span class="propertyStyle">Highlight Surrounds:</span>  This will highlight the terrain area over which the heights will be leveled gradually from the road height to the original terrain height.</li>
	        <li>	          <span class="propertyStyle">Hide White Surfaces:</span> This will hide the white surfaces surrounding the road and connection objects. Depending on the road shader these white surfaces may render through the road. This can be adjusted by reducing the Offset values towards 0 on the material in /Assets/EasyRoads3D/Resources/Materials/surfaceMaterial</li>
	        <li><span class="propertyStyle">Enable Side Object Handles:</span> This will display handles in scene view to control for example the Start and End offsets for side objects. The H key can be used for this as well.</li>
	        <li><strong class="propertyStyle">Display Critical Areas: </strong>The unity terrain object stores Terrain height data in decimals between 0 and 1. Therefore it is not possible to apply negative height values. Parts that are nearby or below the 0 value will be displayed with red handles. This can be used to quickly double check these critical areas and to make sure the terrain does not break through the roads.</li>
	        <li><span class="propertyStyle">Only Display Markers Selected Road:</span> only the blue markers of the selected road will be displayed when a road objectis selected.</li>

	        <li><span class="propertyStyle">Scene Objects Control:</span> By default Unity will select the object in the scene when it is clicked. To keep the road network selected when adding markers or selecting roads or crossing objects, click events on the terrain are intercepted. Other large objects like water surfaces can interfere, they will be selected when clicked. Optionally this type of objects can be added here by dropping them from the hierarchy in the &quot;Add Object&quot; slot. Just like with the terrain object, double click will still select this object.</li>

	      Especially when building complex road networks with different road types  it is recommended to setup road presets before actually building your roads in the scene. These presets will be available when <a href="toolbar.html#addroad" class="link">adding a new road</a> to the scene or when setting up crossing / connection objects and is an easy way to make sure road types look the same and match with the associated crossing types. EasyRoads3D road types can also be linked to <a href="#importData" class="link">OSM road types</a>.<br>

	          - <strong>End Rotation:</strong> This can be useful when the decal is used both at the start and end of the road and the orientation should be flipped. In that case a value of 180 will do that<br>
	         
            </li>
</ul>
<p class="style1"><strong>Side Objects:</strong><span class="header2"><a name="rtSideObjects" id="addmarkers12"></a></span></p>
Side objects can be activated for road types. These side objects will be activated automatically for new instances. It is still possible to deactivate the side object for a road when the side object is not required for that specific road.

<ul>
        <li><span class="propertyStyle">Is Side Object:</span> When toggled on no actual road mesh will be created. This sort of &quot;road&quot; types can be used to create other ready-to-use objects like fences based on side objects by activating the specific side object for this &quot;road&quot; type (see further below). This feature is also used for the river example in the demo project</li>
</ul>
<p class="style1"><strong>Active Side Objects:</strong></p>
<p class="style1">Here all available side objects will be listed, after activating a side object a foldout menu will appear with road specific controls that will also be available on all road instances. By default the values are inherited from the settings in the Side Object Manager. Here they can be fine tuned per road type.</p>

<p class="style1"><strong>Buttons:</strong></p>
<ul>
        <li><span class="propertyStyle">Create Snap Connector:</span> This will create a snap copnnector prefab in /Assets/EasyRoads3D/prefab sources/snap connectors/. Snap Connector prefabs can be attached to any other prefab in the scene. Roads / side objects of this type can be attached quickly to these prefabs or new roads / side objects can be pulled out from the prefabs. Think of . Like a central wall post where multiple wall side objects can connect to. Add  snap connectors with the specific wall side object auto activated to the wall post prefab. In the scene new walls can be pulled out, existing walls  can be attached quickly to the pillar exactly aligned with the center al wall post. Or for roads, imagine buildings, houses  with driveways, attach a snap connector to the garage door, snap the driveway  road object and it will align instantly with the garage door.</li>
	        <li><span class="propertyStyle">Update Scene Instances: </span>This will update all road instances in the scene and crossings that match this road type<br>
        </li>
	      </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p><strong class="header2">CROSSING / CONNECTION PREFABS</strong><span class="style21"> [Pro]<a name="sceneprefabs" id="addmarkers2"></a></span></p>
<p><img src="../images/crossingPrefabs.jpg" width="516" height="310"></p>
<p>EasyRoads3D supports two systems to create crossings, often referred to as &quot;connection prefabs&quot; because these type of objects do not necessarily have to be crossings, but can also, for example, be mesh based crosswalk prefabs. The main system is the <a href="#dynamiccrossings" class="link">dynamic prefabs system</a>, these are built-in customizable connection prefabs. The second, very powerful system, is the <a href="#customcrossings" class="link">custom mesh prefab system</a> with which you can turn your own models into connection prefabs. You can use this to further customize your road networks whilst still taking advantage of the EasyRoads3D scene workflow.</p>
<p><strong>DYNAMIC CROSSING PREFABS<a name="dynamiccrossings" id="customcrossings2"></a></strong></p>
<p>The dynamic crossing system currently supports creating new standard X , T crossings and roundabout prefabs. This is especially useful when you have many similar types of crossings in the scene. By creating a prefab first, the prefab can be reused  in the scene without having to customize it each time. It is still possible to create variations of an instance of this prefab in the scene.<br>
  <br>
  These dynamic prefabs will be stored in:</p>
<p>/Assets/EasyRoads3D/Resources/dynamic prefabs</p>
<p>Dynamic X and T connection prefabs for newly created road types can be  created automatically from the <a href="#newConnectionPrefab" class="link">road types section</a> , or in this section:</p>
<p>1) Enter a name for the new crossing prefab in the &quot;New Prefab Name&quot; textfield.</p>
<p>2) 
  Select from the dropdown what type of crossing preset you want to create, crossing or roundabout. You can also create a new prefab from an already existing prefab by selecting this existing prefab from the <strong>Create Copy of</strong> dropdown. This is useful to quickly create prefabs with variations.</p>
<p>3) Click the <strong>Create</strong> resp. <strong>Create New Prefab</strong> (in case you create a copy of an existing prefab) button. This will create the new prefab in the above mentioned folder</p>
<p>At this stage the new prefab can be edited fro in side project folder by opening it in the Inspector &gt; Open Prefab</p>
<p><strong><br>
  NOTE:</strong> Dynamic X and T connection prefabs for newly created road types can be  created quickly from the <a href="#newConnectionPrefab" class="link">road types section</a>. The new connection prefab will inherit the the settings of the selected road type.</p>

	      <p>The UV Texture window will appear with the selected road texture displayed on the canvas. This window can be used to correctly map the sidewalk UVs. Drag the green handles horizontally. You will see that the UVs update directly in the scene. It is recommended to start with the sidewalk on the left side of the connection (looking towards the center of the object). If the sidewalk on the right side matches you can afterwards click the <strong>mirror</strong> button, this will mirror the left hand UVs for the right side.</p>

	      <p>Below are the recommended steps to create a new roundabout prefab especially when working with larger road widths than the default width of 5</p>
	      <ol>
	        <li>Delete connections so only one connection remains</li>
	        <li>Set the radius to a safe larger value, for example 20</li>
	        <li>Depending on the width of connection 1, move the Position value further in CW direction so the connection will fit well to accomodate the below step 4.</li>
	        <li>Select the road type for this connection and move the Position back to the lowest possible value (see the below NOTE with regard to the visible blue and red handles)</li>
	        <li>Press &quot;Add Connection&quot;, select the road type for this connection and move the connection towards connection 1 to create space for the next connection</li>
	        <li>Repeat step 5. note that the connections will be redistributed around the roundabout. When no connection is inserted, it means that the radius and current connection positions do not allow for a new connection to be added. In that case, either reposition connections and / or increase the radius</li>
	        <li>Repeat these steps until all connections are added</li>
	        <li>Optionally the radius can now be adjusted, there will be messages in the console when the radius has become too small</li>
	        <li>Optionally at this point &ldquo;Distribute  Connections Evenly&rdquo; can be used to rearrange the connections around the roundabout	      </li>
	      </ol>
	      <p>NOTE: The blue handles show the boundaries of the selected connection. The red handles show the available space between which the selected connection can be repositioned</p>

	      <p><strong>CUSTOM CROSSING PREFABS <span class="style21">[Pro]</span><a name="customcrossings" id="customcrossings"></a></strong></p>
          <p>Custom connection prefabs are mesh based prefabs prepared to be used within the EasyRoads3D system. These can be your own unique models created in a modelling app. The system supports prefabs with child objects and submeshes. Currently all prefab mesh data will be read in.  </p>
          <p><a href="http://youtu.be/yDUhBZg7tQM" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/yDUhBZg7tQM</a> - customized road networks - Part 1<br>
          <a href="http://youtu.be/qxeLHG7K9xQ" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/qxeLHG7K9xQ</a> - customized road networks - Part 2          </p>
          <p>This is how it works:</p>
          <p>1. Select the General Settings tab from the toolbar in the Inspector.<br>
            2. Open the Crossing / Connection Prefabs foldout.<br>
            3. Click <strong>Create New Custom Prefab</strong>, the Custom Connection Prefab window will appear.</p>
<p><img src="../images/custom_editor_1.jpg" width="1162" height="799"></p>
<p><br>
        4. Drop your mesh object from the project folder on the stage. It will be assigned to the <strong>Source Object</strong> slot at the top left. <br>
        5. Make sure the geometry is displayed top down. Try a different axis from the <strong>Trace</strong> dropdown if this is not the case. <br>
        6. Recalculate Normals. This will assign normals to the mesh using Unity's Mesh.RecalculateNormals() which is also used on the generated roads. It can be useful to achieve a smooth transition from the crossing to the road.<br>
        7. <strong>Recalculate Tangents</strong>: This will recalculate the tangents which is required when a different roation was applied above in <span class="propertyStyle">Trace On: </span><br>
        8. Click <strong>Build Connection Prefab</strong>. This will create the new custom crossing prefab in the folder /Assets/EasyRoads3D/Resources/custom prefabs<br>
  9. The next step is to assign the vertices that will connect to roads attached to the first connection. This is done by drawing a rectangle (Shift + Left Mouse Button+ Drag) around these vertices holding the Shift key. For complex meshes you can use Stage Rotation so the required vertices fit nicely inside the rectangle. The selected vertices will be highlighted in green.<br>
  10. After selecting the connection vertices the system will check the list of available road types for matches and will auto select a matching road type. You can change this when there are more matches.<br>
  11. Click <strong>New Road Type</strong> to create a new road type for this connection. This is optional. The advantage is that this road type will be auto selected for other generated connections matching this connection. You will also be able to auto activate side objects to this road types which will be automatically assigned to these road types in the scene. And you will be able to create these type of roads directly in the scene from the second tab on the left in the Insepctor. <strong>Note: </strong>This does require road shape data, if no nodes have been selected yet for this connection, the button will be disabled.<br>
  12. Select the road material for the attached road from the  <strong>Road Material</strong> drop down or assign it manually by dropping the material from the assets folder in the material slot below the Road Material dropdown.<br>
  13. The UV Editor window allows you to make changes to the UV layout used on roads attached to this connection.
  <a href="#uvEditor" class="link">Click here</a> for more info.<br>
  14. If you want the connection to align with the connected road angle, you can set additional bending settings. Use <strong>Distance</strong> and <strong>Extend Bounds</strong> to set the bending strength and affected vertices. You can test the bending through the <strong>Deform Test</strong> slider. [All this is currently not yet active]<br>
  15. <strong>Top View</strong> / <strong>Front View</strong> will switch between displaying the full prefab top down and displaying the selected connection geometry from the front view.<br>
  16. To add more connections, Click <strong>Add Connection</strong> and  repeat the steps starting at 9.<br>
  17.
  In order to deform the terrain according the mesh shape make sure <strong>Terrain Deformation</strong> is checked. You will see blue points on the stage which will be used as a reference for the deformation shape. This is currently working for standard shapes like crossings and simple objects like crosswalks. More options will follow and will make it possible to customize the deformation shape and have terrain flattening work for more complex shapes.<br>
  18. Click Apply to the save the changes. </p>
<p>The new custom crossing prefab will now appear in the list of available custom crossing prefabs in the scene tab when the first or last marker is selected and in the prefabs tab where you can select the new custom prefab and directly instantiate it in the scene.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Add connections in clockwise direction preferably starting at the bottom.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Already generated custom prefabs can be edited by opening the window and dragging the prefab from the the assets folder (/Assets/EasyRoads3d/Resources/custom prefabs/) directly on the stage or in the <strong>Crossing Prefab</strong> slot.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In order to be able to edit custom prefabs in a later stage, do not remove the original mesh object from the assets folder.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The terrain will be flattened according the local Y=0 position. Depending on the model type, make sure that all vertices are at Y = 0 or higher.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> to avoid z-fighting / flickering make sure to use one of the EasyRoads3D shaders on the material assigned to the custom prefab.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although this system should support relatively complex shapes (also none roads related), connections should always point outwards relative to the center of the object. Meaning, roads/tracks connected to this crossing should move away from the center at the connection point which usually is the case for road type of networks. So make sure the center of the mesh bounding box is at the pivot point, the larger blue dot in the image above.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The system supports, non &quot;flat&quot;  connections for prefabs that do n ot connect with the terrain. This is useful to create for example bridge elements as part of the road geometry. Please check the example prefabs in the package on how to set this up. Important is that the UVs of the vertices where the geometry connects are accurate, 0 resp 1. A small inaccuracy of up to 0.01 will work but you do want to stay within this margin. If the connection does not extract well, this is the first thing to double check. Also make sure to not close the connection area with triangles that will not be visible anyway after connecting roads. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>This custom crossing prefabs system has been tested with a large number of different meshes. Models however can have any arbitrary shape. If you experience issues when using this system with your own models, please report this with preferably the source mesh included by contacting us at <a href="mailto: info@unityterraintools.com" class="link">info@unityterraintools.com</a></p>

  <!-- MENU-LOCATION=NONE -->
  <img src="../images/uvEditor.jpg" alt="" width="866" height="592"></p>
<p>The UV Editor window can be used to make changes to the UV layout for <a href="#sidewalks" class="link">dynamic crossing sidewalks</a> and road connections added to <a href="#customcrossings" class="link">custom crossing prefabs</a>. By default UVs are calculated within the 0..1 range based on the distances between these vertices. </p>
<p>The textures assigned to the used material for these objects is displayed on the canvas. At the bottom you will see the UVs positions per vertex. If this is not accurate, You can move these points to the matching position on the texture.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle"><strong>Planar UVs</strong>: </span>This will auto generate the UVs ignoring the Y position of the vertex.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle"><strong>Copy UVs from source mesh</strong>:</span> This option is displayed when the UV Editor window is opened from the <a href="#customcrossings" class="link">Custom Crossing Editor</a> window. It will set the U coordinate to the same U value as the matching vertex. You can use this to quickly assign UVs when the road material texture exactly matches the texture used on the source prefab for the connection vertices.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Hard Edge:</span> This option is displayed when the UV Editor window is opened from the <a href="#customcrossings" class="link">Custom Crossing Editor</a> window. By default the road mesh should inherit the normal groups of the source mesh. &quot;Hard Edge&quot; represents smooth or hard edges on matching triangles for the selected node (this is read only).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>When the UV Editor window is opened from the Custom Crossing editor, selecting a point will highlight the corresponding vertex in the Custom Crossing editor window. This way you can see for which vertex you are adjusting the UVs. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When using Copy UVs from source Mesh and the connection has a closed geometry structure (the first and last vertex positions are the same), usually these vertices use x = 0 and x = 1 as the UV coordinate. It could be that these values are assigned to the wrong vertex and  need to be swapped. You will clearly see this in the scene after attaching a road, the full texture is visible between two vertices. Swapping the UVs is done by dragging the most left (0) to the most right position (1) and the most right to the most left. <em>[Add this to trouble shooting as well]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Side Objects on Custom Connections</strong></p>
<p>When <a href="side_objects.html#generateOnConnections" class="link">Generate on Connections</a> is enabled for a side object, this side object will be auto generated on connection objects when the side object is active on both road objects on that connection side. </p>
<p>The curve for this will be auto generated when possible, this should be on the edge. For more complex custom connectors this may not be accurate. It is possible to customize the curve in the Unity Prefab Editor.</p>
<p>Select the generated prefab in the project folder: /Assets/EasyRoads3D/Resources/custom prefabs/ and press the &quot;Open Prefab&quot; button in the Inspector.</p>
<p>Make sure the &quot;Side Object Data&quot; tab is active, visible halfway on the right in the below image.</p>
<img src="../images/customConnectorInspector.jpg" height="598">

<p>Here the curve can be set for each individual Connection. It is possible to connect the side object over the full distance  between the two connectors, &quot;Join on Left side&quot; and &quot;Join on Right Side&quot;. In that case the full shape will be visible and editable. The system will automatically distribute the nodes evenly between the two connectors.</p>
<p>When the curve is empty or when you prefer a different curve it is possible to  create a new list of nodes by entering the Node Count.</p>
<p>Nodes can be selected and moved in the Viewport to shape the curve.</p>
<p>The curve can be reset to the originally extracted nodes by pressing the respective &quot;Reset to Default Nodes&quot; button. This will update the curve or leave a message when no data is available.</p>
<p>&quot;Update Scene Instances&quot; will update all matching objects in the scene according the new curve data.</p>

	      <p><img src="../images/terrain_management.jpg" width="528" height="191"></p>
	      <p>EasyRoads3D will alter the Unity terrain object(s) in the scene. Here you can create backups and restore your original terrains. Whenever a new terrain object is detected in the scene you will be asked to create a backup. It is recommended to do so. It is also recommended to update these backups after manual changes to the terrain	to keep these backups up-to-date.	      </p>
	      <p>The backup / restore options are also displayed in the Inspector of each individual terrain object in the scene.</p>
	      <p>Alternatively you can also for example create backups of your terrain by duplicating the corresponding terrain asset in the project folder. Simply drag this terrain asset in the scene to replace the corresponding terrain you want to restore.</p>
	      <p><strong>Tree Distance</strong> and <strong>Detail Distance</strong> refer to the surface outside the road where trees and detail objects should be removed.	      </p>

	      <p><strong>Vegetation Studio</strong></p>
	      <p>EasyRoads3D supports <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/vegetation-studio-103389" class="link">Vegetation Studio</a>. Options for adding either a Vegetation Studio Mask Line component or a Biome Mask Area component and an activation checkbox will be available when Vegetation Studio is present. Road type specific perimeters or biome mask options can be set for that road type in General Settings &gt; Road	Types      </p>

	      <p class="header2"><strong>IMPORT ROAD DATA <span class="style21">[Pro]</span><a name="importData" id="importData"></a></strong></p>
<p>Road data from external sources can be imported directly into EasyRoads3D v3. The roads will be  created automatically.</p>
<p><img src="../images/import_data.jpg" width="516" height="715"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default EasyRoads3D will match the bounds in the data file with the bounds of the terrain. However, if the coordinates do not exactly match those of the terrain, the terrain bounds can be entered in the corresponding terrain longitude / latitude fields. The data will be parsed relative to these terrain coordinates.</p>

<p><strong>Open Street Map</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org" class="link">openstreetmap.org</a> , zoom in to the location of your choice. Click the green &quot;Export&quot; item at the top. You will see lon lat coordinates and additional info at the left. Click the blue &quot;Export&quot; button. This will generate an *.osm file. </p>
<p>For OSM data EasyRoads3D road types can be linked to OSM road types. For each OSM road type select the EasyRoads3D road type from the dropdown. For KML files a single road type can be selected. </p>
<p>Click the<strong> Open OSM File</strong> or <strong>Open KML File</strong> button in the Inspector and select the downloaded file. The system will extract the data and create the roads.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: </strong>The <strong>Stream OSM Data</strong> option is not yet functional. </p>
