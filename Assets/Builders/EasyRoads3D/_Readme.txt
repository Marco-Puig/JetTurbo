Thank you for purchasing EasyRoads3D Pro

This package includes the EasyRoads3D Pro tool and the basic demo scene.

It is recommended to spend some time getting familiar with the tool before starting to use it in your projects. 

The manual is located in the EasyRoads3D root directory. The first pages of the manual explain the main work flow.

To get familiar with the tool you can also download the free demo project: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/easyroads3d-demo-project-105045

The demo package includes a wide range of additional road type and side object assets. It is recommended to import this package in a new project first. But it can also be imported in your project 
if you want to use all assets. Otherwise assets can be exported / imported. 

The road types and side objects in the demo project can be used in your own personal and commercial projects except for asset store packages. 
Please contact us for permission to use these assets in Unity asset store packages or for example open source Unity projects.
